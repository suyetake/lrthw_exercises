*What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
>For me personally, the three most essential skills are attention to detail, persistance, and empty before you fill.
>From the chapter, the three most essential skills for a beginning programmer are reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.

*Please explain these three skills in your own words.
>Attention to detail is related to spotting differences because you must continually compare what you are writing to what you need to accomplish. The Acceptance Criteria are meant as a Test-First for yourself to see if what is provided is what is sought before tossing your Finished story into the ring to be judged as accepted or rejected. Reading and writing are the communication skills needed to convey what issues you are encountering or to express why a deviation from the intended course of events (Tasks) became necessary to acheive the desired outcome.

*Why do you need to not copy and paste?
>Muscle Memory is needed to quickly type common (and uncommon) commands when your focus is centered on the problem at hand, not the syntax. Copy and paste takes your focus away from the problem and does not reinforce your muscle memory to type commands quickly.

*Why is Practice and Persistence important?
>Practice and Persistance is important because it adds the ingredient of time and experience. When results do not match expectations, persistance is needed to discover the correction to make to the code and to the learning taking place.
